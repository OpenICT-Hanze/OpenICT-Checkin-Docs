Welcome to the OpenICT, Check In website documentation!
===================================

**OpenICT checkin** is a website made by the student to put their own hosted "check in". Together with the OpenICT way of learning, the whole project is managed by the SCRUM process and will be maintained by the students in this semester or internship.

Check out the :ref:`installation` page to set up the program for yourself. Or check out the :ref:`api` if you already have everything set up locally.

.. note::

   This project is under active development and will have frequent changes to the project and this documentation. Make sure to check back often is something is not working as it should.
